				My interest in programming began with a fascination with video games. I spent a lot of time when I was younger playing
				flash games on contributor driven sites like Kongregate. Some of the best games were simple and designed by kids no older
				than me. I enjoyed playing the games and wondered if I could make them. So I began learning Python to get an understanding
				of the simpler concepts and syntax of programming. From there I learned ActionScript 3 and made a couple simple working games.
				<br> <br>
				In that time I discovered I loved programming. The challenge and discovery of creating something drew me in and I would
				program and look up syntax for hours at a time. At the time I still had misguided ideas about transitioning to a career
				in development and thought it was out of reach. After some research I decided that at the very least I wanted to try.
				I was drawn to Javascript as it could accomplish similar functions with canvas as ActionScript and Flash but with
				wider support. With many browsers disabling Flash as the default I felt Javascript was a better language to focus on.
				<br> <br>
				I've began learning Javascript and related technologies through books on packt and courses on Free Code Camp. In the last
				year I was very fortunate to apply and advance through a scholarship with Google on Udacity that has solidified my
				technical web abilities, allowed me to produce a functioning project, and left me confident that I am ready for a full time position.

				<br><br>
				Currently my main goal is to transition to a full time development job. I want to obtain real world experience working on a
				team, producing code, and experiencing full time development. Through Udacity I received professional feedback and was able
				to produce several finalized projects. In a programming job I feel I'll be able to grow much faster while simultaneously
				doing something that I love.
				<br><br>
				In the future I see myself learning more advanced technologies. I've spent some time working on NodeJS and I love the structure.
				My next goal would be to dive into full stack and gain experience for both front and back end. I'd enjoy working through MEAN stack,
				learning synchronous new technologies and growing as a developer.
